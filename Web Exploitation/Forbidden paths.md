# Forbidden paths

### Approach Used
We can see from the questions description that we are currently in the 'html' directory so if climb a directory and write the the whole path, we can still read the txt file. For example: if we write '../html/divine-comedy.txt

Now we will just climb the required no. of directories so first '..' for html, second for nginx, third for share and forth for the usr directory. So we have to write '../../../../flag.txt' and by this we will gwt the flag.
