### Approach used
After observing 'vuln.c', we can only see one vulnerability which we can use to break in cause it only has 'printf(user_buf)' and no format string like '%s' or something.

Now we will use the command given in the question 'nc mercury.picoctf.net 53437' and first type 1 to buy some stonks and type any random thing in api token. We can also check 2nd option.

This time we will choose option 1 again but in the api token we will use a format string like '%p'.

We will get a code in the 'buying stonks with token' and now we just have to type %p many times to get the flag.

Now we got the token but we have to decode it so for that we will go to [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and use from hex recipe and paste the token here.

We can see there something written in the form of flag so first we will remove unnecessary terms.

We can see that we have almost got the flag but it is in reverse so we will use swap endianess to reverse it

We can see we have got the flag.
