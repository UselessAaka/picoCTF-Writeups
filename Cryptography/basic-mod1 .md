### Approach used
First we will download the file using 'wget' command, then use cat to read the file.

 We get a sequence of numbers `165 248 94 346 299 73 198 221 313 137 205 87 336 110 186 69 223 213 216 216 177 138`. Now we will make a python file named 'basic-mod1.py' and use 'nano' editor to write the code.

We are using for loop to get the characters for every number and now we will just run the python file.

Hence, we will get the flag.
