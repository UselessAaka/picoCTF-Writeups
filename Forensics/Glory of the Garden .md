### Approach used
After downloading the file we can either use the 'xxd' command in linux or online hex editor [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/) to see its hexdump and get info from it. But while scrolling i saw that at the very end there is something written in the picoCTF flag format .

So thsi is the flag.
### Flag
> Here is a flag "picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}".
