### Approach Used
After downloading the image we can see that it is a photo of a Matryoshka doll which basically are a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another. So because of this I thought of unzipping this and then I found a directory 'base_images' then I enter it and find 2_c.jpg then I again unzip and do the same process until $_c.jpg. After unzipping this I get a file 'flag.txt' so we will just read it and get the flag.
